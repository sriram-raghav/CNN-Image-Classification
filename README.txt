The S3 bucket URLs are fully public and nothing should be needed to access our dataset.

We did not make any assumptions; we used a prebuilt dataset and added some of our own layers.

To run our code, use any platform to run the .ipynb file such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (preferred). Connect to the GPU within Google Colab to expedite model training speed.
